# Code Nummies

Code Nummies are bite sized challenges about a specific topic. Every Nummy will explain that very topic and provide
instructions on how to tackle the problem as well as some code to get you kickstarted. A Code Nummy will take around 30
minutes to complete.

When learning passively, it happens to me more than often that I say "yes, I would have done it in a similar way". Most
of the time, I am missing out on the crucial parts. The tricky questions will only pop up, once I get my hands dirty and
craft a solution on my own. If you have similar experience, Code Nummies will be very helpful to you. The idea is to get
proper hands-on experience and craft a solution on your own.

To smooth out the experience, the Code Nummies will offer a set of instructions and provide us with everything to get
started. Tests are provided and will guide the implementation. Most Nummies also contain some
applications, that will provide nice results.

# Getting Started

## Download a Nummy

You can download a Nummy either via the `Code` -> `Download ZIP` button on github, or
via [git clone](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository).

## Creating the project files with CMake

Navigate to the folder of the Nummy you want to exercise and type

```shell
cmake .
```

in a terminal. CMake supports multiple IDEs, see
the [list of generators](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html).

## IDEs
